      <h2>Analysis of the Image</h2>
      <p>
        The image titled <em>The Chinese Opium Smoker No. 12</em> comes from a series of 
        illustrations showing the destructive effects of the opium trade in China. It depicts 
        an opium smoker struggling to survive in the winter, eventually finding shelter in a 
        cave where he dies. This visual representation directly contrasts with the British 
        perspectives found in the <em>Records of the Royal Commission on Opium</em>. In the 
        document, British officials repeatedly defend the opium trade by focusing on its 
        economic importance to the Indian government. They describe opium as a necessary 
        source of revenue and downplay its harmful effects by shifting responsibility to 
        Chinese authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The image challenges that narrative by focusing on the personal and social 
        consequences of addiction. While the Commission frames the trade in terms of 
        legality, treaties, and financial stability, the illustration forces viewers to 
        confront the human suffering caused by those policies. Together, the document 
        and the image reveal the gap between imperial justification and lived reality, 
        helping us better understand the moral complexity of the opium trade.
